Architecture-Simulator
======================
The Architecture-Simulator is a software for educational purpose. The primary goal is to illustrate simple computer and processor
architectures. It visualizes simple architectures based on primitive components like buses, registers, alus, multiplexers and ram.


Features
======================
* Create your own architecture like the theoretical MU0 (MU0-2,...)
* Create your own assambler instructions for your architecture by setting register input or output on the falling or rising edge and by performing one or multiple alu opperations
* Write your own programs for your own architecture
