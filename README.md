Architecture-Simulator
======================
The Architecture-Simulator is a software for educational purpose. The primary goal is to illustrate simple computer and processor
architectures. It visualizes simple architectures based on primitive components like buses, registers, alus, multiplexers and ram.


Features
======================
* Create your own architecture like the theoretical MU0 (MU0-2,...)
* Create your own assabler instructions for your build architecture by setting register input or output on the falling or recing edge
* Write your own programms for your own architecture
