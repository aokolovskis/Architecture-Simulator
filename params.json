The primary goal is to illustrate simple computer and processor\r\narchitectures. It visualizes simple architectures based on primitive components like buses, registers, alus, multiplexers and ram.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n======================\r\n* Create your own architecture like the theoretical MU0 (MU0-2,...)\r\n* Create your own assambler instructions for your architecture by setting register input or output on the falling or rising edge and by performing one or multiple alu opperations\r\n* Write your own programs for your own architecture \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started \r\n======================\r\n\r\nLoad Simulation\r\n----------------------\r\n1. File->Open\r\n2. Select the architecture you want to load e.g. ”mu0-2.architecture.xml”. \r\n3. Now you have to select the correct layout” mu0-2.layout.xml”. \r\n4. Setup. \r\n\r\nUsage\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n### The two buttons (Micro Step / Instrucation)\r\n\r\n#### Micro Step\r\nPerformes micro step.\r\n#### Instruction \r\nPerformes instruction, if an instructon is currently executed it will \r\nbe finished. \r\n\r\nReset \r\n----------------------\r\nThis resets the Architecture Simulator. Note: All Components will have the value witch they had after setup. \r\nInstuction Table\r\n----------------------  \r\nIn this window you can see the detailed execution steps for all known instruction. Also you can see the the binary mask for each instruction. \r\nExecution Log \r\n----------------------\r\nThis window shows you all instructions that have been executed. \r\nAdditonal functions \r\n----------------------\r\nSome of the Components have additonal functionality. \r\nmemory a click on it will chnge the displayed base. supported bases are 2,10,16 can load different values e.g. ”example-programm.ram.xml”\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
